Further donations are still welcome and will go to projects that Renade was active in and that were close to her heart. The collected funds enable her burial in the forest cemetery (Friedwald) at Burg Plesse — at Renade’s chosen resting place next to her friend Lena.",

You could hear her coming from afar, her voice always resonated throughout the ThOP. Now it has fallen silent, but its echo will accompany us for a long time.\n\nOn the night of 28.08.2025, our long-time collaborator Renate Hillebrandt (Renade) passed away after a short and serious illness.\n\nHer absence tears a hole in our midst. We are incredibly sad.\n\nIf you were able to get to know Renate over the roughly 20 years in which she contributed to the Theater im ThOP with commitment, a full heart, and complete dedication, we would be glad if you joined us in remembrance.\n\nThe ensemble of the current production ‘Lady Windermere’s Fan’, in which Renate continued to work until the end as assistant director and actor, has set up a memorial table at ThOP. You can leave a few kind words there.\n\n[...]\n\nWe would also like to invite you to a gathering at ThOP to think of Renate together and talk about her. People from other social contexts that Renate (Renade) was part of will also take part. The date is 14.09 (a Sunday) from 16:00 to about 21:00. The official part starts at 16:30. If you would like to contribute a speech or something musical, please contact Christa (christa.thop@web.de) by 10.09.\n\nA piano will be on stage on 14.09 and can be used; we are also happy about any photos you bring.\n\nYour ThOP people,\nIn quiet and loud remembrance"
